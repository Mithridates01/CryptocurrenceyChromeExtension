Adding a Chrome extension to your local version of Chrome is a quick and process. First access the extensions page chrome://extensions and turn on "Developer mode" on the upper right section of the screen. Then on the left side of the header, click "Load unpacked extension..." and once prompted with the finder, select the root directory of the Chrome extension.
Give it a refresh and you will see it in all its glory in the extensions bar.
